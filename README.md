### Introduction

*The introduction is on the way~*

[//]: # (TODO: Write a project description)

### How to use

#### Download the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenFromHRBUST/Object-Recognition.git
```

#### Install the dependencies (not available yet, please install them manually)

[//]: # (TODO: add requirements.txt)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure the project
To protect possible privacy settings, you need to create your own `config.py` file. You can copy the `config.template.py` file and rename it to `config.py`. Then you can configure the project according to your own needs.
```bash
# Copy the config.template.py file and rename it to config.py
cp config.template.py config.py

# Edit the config.py file using your favorite editor (e.g. vim)
vim config.py
```

If you want to use wandb, you need to set the `api_key` in the config.py file. It will only be used when you set the `production` to True.

#### Run the project
```bash
python main.py
```
